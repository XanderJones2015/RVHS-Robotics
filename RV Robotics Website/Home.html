            <h1><b><p class="textindentsmall">What is BEST Robotics?</p></b></h1>
            <p class="textindentmedium">This team participates in the annual Boosting Engineering, Science, and Technology (BEST) Robotics competition. <br> Teams will have six weeks to design, construct, and test robots that are able to accomplish a variety of tasks as outlined in the game’s design. <br> At the kickoff meeting, teams will receive their kits and will be able to get a firsthand look at the gamefield for the year. <br> After six weeks, robots will compete against each other in order to score the most points. <br> In addition to the robotic competition, there is also a marketing and business competition in which teams create an interactive booth, <br> two presentations, and outreach factors that promote BEST and the team.</p>
            
            <h1><b><p class="textindentsmall">Sounds fun! What do I need to participate?</p></b></h1>
            <p class="textindentmedium">$25 team member fee: this covers t-shirts and extra expenses such as tools and other materials.</p>
            <p class="textindentmedium">Availability: Our team meetings are important, and especially as game day approaches, we have to have everyone available. Different parts of the team will have slightly different meeting times.</p>
            <p class="textindentmedium">Good attitude: We’re here to work as a team and have a great time! Things can get stressful and sometimes a bit annoying, however we need everyone to have respect for their fellow teammates and our parent mentors.</p>

            <h2><b><p class="textindentsmall">Design / Build Team</p></b></h2>
            <p class="textindentmedium">This is the core of the robotic competition. This group takes information from the rules of the game and specific measurements to create a design that is able to accomplish some or all of the outlined tasks. <br> PARTICIPATION IN THIS GROUP REQUIRES PASSING A QUIZ.</p>
            
            <h2><b><p class="textindentsmall">Robot Drive / Pit Crew</p></b></h2>
            <p class="textindentmedium">Crew: This team executes the robot’s abilities on the game field and ensures the robot is in working condition for each match. <br >The drive team consists of drivers (people who operate the robot) and spotters (people who guide the driver and accomplish other tasks). <br> For this group, communication and understanding of the robot’s functions is crucial. <br> THIS TEAM HAS TRYOUTS</p>
            
            <h2><b><p class="textindentsmall">Gamefield Build Team</p></b></h2>
            <p class="textindentmedium">This group assembles 1⁄4 of the gamefield for the robot to practice on. Anyone can join, however once the gamefield is assembled, members of this group will likely be reassigned to other jobs.</p>
            
            <h2><b><p class="textindentsmall">Programming and Simulink</p></b></h2>
            <p class="textindentmedium">This group creates the program that allows the robot to move, and works with all of the electrical components of the robot (i.e. wiring). Anyone can join, and new members will be taught the basics of EasyC- the program we use.</p>
            
            <h2><b><p class="textindentsmall">Marketing Presintation</p></b></h2>
            <p class="textindentsmall">This group is one of the primary representations of our team.
